# UniversitySystem
# This University Registration System has a some installs that must be followed in order to properly run it.
# You need to install the MySQL community server -> http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/
# Ensure it is running and you can access the server
# The included jar file is the library required to connect MySQL to java and run everything properly.
# You need to add this source file to your classpath so that java can recognize it
# If in eclipse you go to Project tab -> Properties and a window will open up
# On the left hand side click Java Build Path->Add JARs.
# Within the UniversitySystem(click arrow to open) navigate to the jar file (mysql-connector-java...) and double click it
# From there clock ok and the window should close.
# The next step is to navigate to the green "run and compile" arrow and hit the down arrow to open up a menu
# Click on run configurations and a window will open up. Click on the ClassPath tab and open the drop down for UniversitySystem
# Click add Jars if the JDBC file is not present and follow the same process as before(drop down arow for UniversitySystem and add the file)
# Once everything is set up
